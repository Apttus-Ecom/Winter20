\n        The asset dropdown button is used to create a split dropdown button with all of the enabled ABO actions on the storefront record.\nBy default the first action in the list of enabled actions is set as the primary action on the button, however, users can set the desired primary action with the 'primaryAction' input.\nAn onClick event is emitted when a user clicks on the main button or one in the dropdown.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { ButtonModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ButtonModule, ...]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n    \n\n\n    \n

start date and one for end date. The input fields use the ngx-bootstrap date picker component.\nBy default the date range component will calculate the begining and ending date for the cart item that is passed to it based on the frequency and term of the product.\nWhen the user selects a date in the start date or end date inputs the onStartDateChange and onEndDateChange methods will be fired respectively.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { InputDateModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [InputDateModule, ...]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n    \n\n\n    \n

The cart icon should be displayed in a fixed header of a page so it is accessible to the user at all times. Once items have been added to the user's current cart a badge will appear next to the Mini Cart icon with the total number of items.\nWhen a user clicks the Mini Cart icon the associated dropdown menu will be displayed. The Mini Cart dropdown menu shows the current line items that have been added to the cart. Line items include information about the product, controls for updating the quantity of items, and a control for removing the item from the cart. A cart total price and checkout button are also shown in the Mini Cart dropdown.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { MiniCartModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [MiniCartModule,

For package and installation assistance, contact Conga Support.\nCreate your first Storefront\nThe Digital Commerce SDK works with the unified data model of the underlying Quote-to-Cash platform. This means that there are no additional data setup procedures for creating and maintaining your storefront catalog.\nTo create your first storefront\n\nUsing CPQ, you must already have the existing data:\nCategories\nProducts\nPrice List\n\n\n\n\nSet up a community - Digital Commerce leverages a Salesforce Community to provide\nauthentication and hosting features for guest users. After the Digital Commerce package is installed\nin your org, you must create a Salesforce Community. For details on setting up a community, refer to Setting Up Communities in the Digital Commerce Implementation and Deployment Guide.\nAt a minimum, you just need the community URL. However, if you intend to support guest users, you\ncan enable it within the community settings. After deployment, the angular library provides a Visualforce\npage that you can set as the default page for all page settings within the community. For example\nHome, Login, Forgot Password, Change Password, and so on. Being a single page application, it is\ndesigned to handle all incoming requests.\n\nCreate a storefront record - Digital Commerce package consists of a Storefront object, an\nunderlying Catalog, and a Tab to map the storefront to the Catalog. You must create a storefront\nrecord. For details on creating a storefront record, refer to Adding a Storefront Record in the Digital Commerce Implementation and Deployment Guide.\nThe storefront record consists of a Storefront Banner related list. For details on adding a\npromotional banner to your storefront, refer to Adding Storefront Promotional Banners in the Digital Commerce Implementation and Deployment Guide.\n If you are using an MDO org, there may already be a Store object installed. This Store object is deprecated in favor of the Storefront object that comes with the Digital Commerce package.\n\n\nAssigning Digital Commerce Permission Set - The Digital Commerce package comes with\nbasic permission set for providing the necessary access to users. For more details on assigning\npermission sets, see Conga E-Commerce Permission Set in the Digital Commerce Implementation and Deployment Guide.\n\n\nInstalling the Angular Library\nEnsure you have access to the Digital Commerce libraries. Contact Conga Support for obtaining access to these libraries. After you have access, to install all the required libraries, run:\nnpm install --save @apttus/core @apttus/ecommerce @apttus/elementsAppModule.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\n\nimport { ApttusModule } from '@apttus/core';\nimport { CommerceModule, TranslatorLoaderService } from '@apttus/ecommerce';\n\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\nimport { ComponentModule } from './components/component.module';\nimport { RouteGuard } from './services/route.guard';\nimport { AuthGuard } from './services/auth.guard';\nimport { ConfigureGuard } from './services/configure.guard';\nimport { ConstraintRuleGuard } from './services/constraint-rule.guard';\n\n// Register locale data\nimport localeMx from '@angular/common/locales/es-MX';\nimport localeMxExtra from '@angular/common/locales/extra/es-MX';\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr';\nimport localeFrExtra from '@angular/common/locales/extra/fr';\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\nimport { ServiceWorkerModule } from '@angular/service-worker';\nimport { ModalModule } from 'ngx-bootstrap/modal';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\nimport { ProductDrawerModule, ApttusModalModule } from '@apttus/elements';\n// If using additional locales, register the locale data here\nregisterLocaleData(localeMx, 'es-MX', localeMxExtra);\nregisterLocaleData(localeFr, 'fr-FR', localeFrExtra);\n\n// Translations\nimport { TranslateModule, TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport { AboGuard } from './services/aboGuard';\nimport { OrderDetailsGuard } from '@apttus/ecommerce';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n    // Pass environment file to ApttusModule.\n    ApttusModule.forRoot(environment),\n    // Pass the string name of the APTSMD_Store__c record you want to use to the CommerceModule.\n    CommerceModule.forRoot('My Store'),\n    ProductDrawerModule,\n    ModalModule.forRoot(),\n    ApttusModalModule,\n    TranslateModule.forRoot({\n      loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: TranslatorLoaderService }\n    }),\n    HttpClientModule,\n    ComponentModule,\n    ServiceWorkerModule,\n    ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })\n  ],\n  providers: [RouteGuard, AuthGuard, AboGuard, ConfigureGuard, ConstraintRuleGuard, OrderDetailsGuard],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }After the library is imported, you can use its components, directives, and pipes in your Angular application:\nDefining a model\nProper state management is crucial to a successful Angular PWA (Progressive Web Application). For this, accessing data within Salesforce requires you to define your model within a Typescript class. Behind the scenes, @apttus/core is managing how your components access and interact with that data to avoid unnecessary operations and maintain synchronicity.\nSee the example illustrated below that defines the account and contact relationship for a component.\nimport { AObject, ATable, AField } from '@apttus/core';\n\n// We use the decorator ATable to tell @apttus/core this class maps to the 'Account' object.\n// In order to access standard sObject fields, our Account class must extend 'AObject' (a subclass of 'SObject).\n// The class name can be anything, but the sobjectName and aqlName properties in the ATable decorator must map\n// to an object API name within Salesforce or AIC respectively.\n@ATable({\n  sobjectName : 'Account',\n  aqlName: 'crm_Account'\n})\nexport class Account extends AObject {\n\n  // Similar to how the ATable decorator is used on model objects the AField decorator is used for fields within the model.\n  // The soql and aql properties must map to a field API name in Salesforce or AIC respectively.\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'Name',\n    aql: 'Name'\n  })\n  public Name: string = null;\n\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'BillingStreet',\n    aql: 'BillingStreet'\n  })\n  BillingStreet: string = null;\n\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'My_Custom_Field__c'\n  })\n  public MyCustomField: number = null;\n\n  //Related Lists\n  @AField({\n    soql: 'PriceListId__r',\n    aql: 'DefaultPriceListId'\n  })\n  PriceList: PriceList = new PriceList();\n}Defining a Service\nAfter defining your model, you can access the data by creating a service for the models. The AObjectService class contains many of the standard DML and query operations to access the data. However, you can add any convenient methods you want to your service. The core service methods are usually very simple.\nimport { AObjectService } from '@apttus/core';\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts'  // This is a reference to the account model created in the previous section\n\n\n@Injectable({\n    providedIn : 'root'\n})\nexport class AccountService extends AObjectService{\n  //Add service methods here\n  type = Account;\n}Access the data in your component\nimport { Component, OnOnit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AccountService } from './account.service.ts';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts';\n\n@Component({\n  selector : 'app-account',\n  template : `\n\n  `,\n  styles : [``]\n})\nexport class AccountComponent implements OnInit{\n\n  constructor(private accountService: AccountService){}\n\n  // Always perform service methods in the ngOnInit method\n  ngOnInit(){\n    this.accountService.where([new ACondition(this.accountService.type, 'Id', 'NotNull', null)], 'AND', null, null, new APageInfo(1, 1)).subscribe(res => {\n      /*\n        res === [\n          {\n            Name: 'Account A',\n            BillingStreet: '1234 Main Street',\n            MyCustomField: 44,\n            PriceList: {\n              ...\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      */\n    });\n    this.accountService.describe(Account, 'MyCustomField', false).subscribe(res => {\n      // Describe information for My_Custom_Field__c\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.search('Main street').subscribe(res => {\n      // SOSL Search Results\n      // Note : search does not follow the model pattern and will return results specified in the query\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.get(['00Fxxxxxxx', '00Fxxxxxxx']).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns an array of account records\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.aggregate([new ACondition(this.accountService.type, 'Id', 'NotNull', null)]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns aggregates for the specified clause. (i.e. total records as well as max/min values for all \n      // fields specified in the model)\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.create([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of id's created\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.update([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of id's updated\n    })  \n\n    this.accountService.upsert([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of objects upserted\n    }) \n\n    this.accountService.delete([new Account()]).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns list of boolean values for accounts that were successfully deleted\n    })\n  }\n}\ndeploy\nTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run lintTo deploy your code to your Salesforce org\n$ npm run deploy\n# Known Issues\n\n\n@Angular/cli 6.0.0 Can't Resolve Stream\nIf you have upgraded to @angular/cli 6, and you're seeing the following error\nWARNING in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/xml2js/node_modules/sax/lib/sax.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\xml2js\\node_modules\\sax\\lib'\n\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/csv-parse/lib/index.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\csv-parse\\lib'\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/csv-stringify/lib/index.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\csv-stringify\\lib'\nERROR in C:/Workspace/ngs-workspace/node_modules/xml2js/lib/parser.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'timers' in 'C:\\Workspace\\ngs-workspace\\node_modules\\xml2js\\lib'\ni ｢wdm｣: Failed to compile.Fix: Add path\nAdd the following to your tsconfig.app.json file under 'compilerOptions':\n\"paths\" : {\n  \"jsforce\" : [\"./node_modules/jsforce/build/jsforce.min.js\"]\n  ...\n}\n\nUncaught Error: No base href set.
